Archaeologists have identified the sacred animal Anubis as an Egyptian canoe, the African golden wolf. The African wolf was formerly called the "African golden jackal", until a 2015 genetic analysis updated the classification and common name for the species. As a result, Anubis is often referred to as having a "jackal" head, but this "jackal" is now more properly called a "wolf". Like many ancient Egyptian deities, Anubis took on different roles in different contexts. Pictured as the protector of tombs since the First Dynasty (c. 3100 - c. 2890 BC), Anubis was also an embalmer. From the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) he was replaced by Osiris in his role as ruler of the underworld. One of his prominent roles was as a god who introduced souls to the afterlife. He watched the scales during the "Weighing of the Heart", in which it was determined whether a soul was not allowed to enter the realm of the dead. Although he was one of the oldest and "one of the most frequently depicted and referenced gods" in the Egyptian pantheon, Anubis played almost no role in Egyptian mythology. Anubis was depicted in black, a color that symbolized the rebirth, life, soil of the Nile River and the discoloration of the corpse after embalming. Anubis is associated with his brother Wepwawet, another Egyptian god depicted with a dog's head or in the form of a dog, but with gray or white fur. Historians assume that the two forms eventually merged. Anubis' female counterpart is Anput. His daughter is the serpent goddess Quebec. </p>
