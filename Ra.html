By the Fifth Dynasty, in the 25th and 24th centuries BC, he had become one of the most important gods in the ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the midday sun. Ra is believed to rule over all parts of the created world: the heavens, the earth, and the underworld. He was the god of the sun, order, kings and heaven.

    Ra was depicted as a hawk and typically shared with the sky god orusro. At times the two deities merged as Ra-Horakhty, "Ra, who is Horus of the Two Horizons". In the New Kingdom, when the god Amun emerged, he merged with Ra as Amun-Ra.
    
    The cult of the bull Mnevis, incarnation of Ra, had the center of Ilioupoli and was the official burial place for the bulls sacrificed north of the city.
    
    All life forms are believed to have been created by Ra. In some accounts, humans were created from Ra's tears and sweat, hence the Egyptians call themselves "Ra Cattle". In the myth of the Celestial Cow, it is narrated how mankind plotted against Ra and how he sent his eye as the goddess Sehmet to punish them. </p>
