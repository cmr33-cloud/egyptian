<b>Sobek</b> (also called <b>Shebek</b>) was a deity with a complex and fluid nature. He is associated with the Nile crocodile or the West African crocodile and is represented either in its form or as a human with a crocodile head. Sobek was also associated with Pharaonic power, fertility, and military prowess, but he also used it as a protective deity with apotropaic qualities, which he invoked specifically to protect himself from the dangers posed by the Nile.
